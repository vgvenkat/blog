Right after I left <a href="https://medium.com/@brunoportnoy/peixe-urbano-explore-the-city-8181f6b1c931" target="_blank">Peixe Urbano</a> on the first quarter of 2013 a friend that was doing some freelance work for Pond5 would have to stop and introduced me to Tom Bennet, the founder and CEO of the company. We’ve got to meet in person since he was in Rio at the time and right. I started to do some freelancing work for the company and then got hired as a full-time employee.

## Understanding The Terrain
First thing I learned was that Pond5 was a small company with an office in New York and then Prague (by acquiring <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/pond5-acquires-pixmac/" target="_blank">Pixmac</a>, a Czech startup). The product team was remotely distributed mostly in Europe, so it took me some time to familiarize myself to the different time zones between Europe, USA, and Brazil. But doesn’t like a new challenge especially while meeting and working with folks from different cultures?

Since the company was founded in 2006, I knew that was going to be a very different path to start shipping value. Besides the fact that the majority of company employees didn’t have a lot of experience on building and shipping products. But since I was the new guy I felt like I should do my best to help everyone see the importance of the shipping relevant and valuable features for users while helping turning the founders vision into reality.

Was also interesting that it was the first startup I worked that was already profitable at the time I joined and also a product that helped hundreds of media artists to live by doing what they do best. You should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk9nOODGn1o">this video</a> that synthesize what <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/pond5-raises-61-million-series-a-led-by-accel-partners-stripes-group/" target="_blank">Pond5</a> is.

A few months after I started to work at Pond5, the company did the first company summit to everyone that work do remotely across the world could finally meet each other. A great opportunity to me, first to visit New York City and to finally meet and do face-to-face work with all my co-workers.


## Cleaning The House
Pond5 never had a full-time designer taking care of the product so when I joined design assets was disorganized in a huge Dropbox folder and many, many files. I deeply believe that to do good work you have to keep it organized. Otherwise, you’ll spend more time dealing with files than actually getting things done. So I started to cleaning up the folder and trying to put some sense in all the pieces.

After all, we decided to let Dropbox go and use Google Drive since the company was paying for Google accounts. So I grabbed everything from Dropbox and put in an OLD folder and then started from scratch. Took me some time to do it but It was needed. Right after that I start making some UI stylesheets, and pieces from the upcoming redesign.

## Starting With The Operator
I never had the idea of how many people were needed to be there curating media all the day so our users can see what’s best and relevant to them. Was quite shocking to see that the UI that they used 8 hours per day was that bad designed, out-dated and highly inefficient. My first project was to redesign the Curators Dashboard and fight for some relevant new features that would improve the work efficiency of these folks.

I started my research based on some notes that they had about the current dashboard, doing some interviews and watching some screen recording on how they were using their tools and where I could start improving.

### Gamification
We though that would be interesting for the company and for the curators to have a status of how much they were curating and what was the current status of all medias.

### Artist Badges
Observing how curators were working, we knew that we should automatically organize different artists into profiles and so we created artist badges to help curators quickly look at long tables and classify the artist. That made it easier to filter the queue having groups of curators focusing on groups of artists.

### Catching Simple Things
Especially when curating images we observed that curators had to download the image, go to photoshop and zoom in at a 100% to check for sharpening, noise, etc. So we made a quick image view/zoom/drag tool to avoid all that time wasted in between downloading and switching programs.

## Time to Redesign
After all the clean up and the ground work with curators, I was ready to start revamping the visual layer of the user-facing product. Redesigning and refactoring are always big decisions in a company life. But there’s a stage where you have to decide and just do it because otherwise you’ll end with a product and engineering team supporting bugs and bad UX instead of innovating and creating value to users.

I always paid attention to the Pond5 User Community, an old forum style system but full of valuable and insightful information about how our users were experiencing the product and what they were wandering next feature wise.

Based on all info I got from our community, analytics and aligned with the business objectives we decided to start with some internal pages first to create a solid foundation. Also having the time to proof and mature the new stuff before revamping the entire home page and other systems like Search Engine or Users Dashboard.

We also knew that our product was outdated for a long time especially comparing with some of the old players and new players on the market. So all the redesign needed to be planned and done as soon as possible to keep existent users and attract new ones.

### Media Players
Pond5 supports an extensive set of media types and aspect ratios from photos and videos to PSDs and 3D files. That make all systems complex because we always have to pay attention to the specifics of each media and make sure we’re approaching it the correct way for the users.

### Media Taxonomy
One of the hardest things to ship at Pond5 was the new taxonomy for the sub-header menu. The challenge was to re-organize all types and subtypes of medias into a new system that also had to be good for upcoming media types in the long term. The strategy was to talk with each media owner and lock the possibilities for each media. Write all down to a spreadsheet and start playing Lego, presenting, getting feedback and repeating until all sides were happy and then putting everything together into a usable UI. We also added smart collections to all media types with the most searched terms.

### Home Page
To get to the most recent home page, I did a lot of concepts. Months were doing wireframes, mockups, and A/B testing small sections and observing users reactions to it. We concluded that the home page should always stay fresh, with new content and telling what Pond5 is in a short sentence. Also, it should feature our best artists and some of our seasonal collections and media.

## A Global Company
Working at Pond5 was for sure the biggest cultural experience in my life so far and the foundation for me to start doing remote work. With offices in NY and Prague, working and meeting people from completely different cultures and countries truly and deeply impacted the way I think, plan and do design.

After almost two years I felt that was time to me to do something new, fresh or just work with different people to see what’s next in my career. I moved on to the next chapter and realized that was a good timing cause Pond5 managed to hire the amazing <a href="http://www.dusko.sk" target="_blank">Dusko</a> to do some contract work right before my exit. I spent my last month helping the transition and letting the things at a good pace.

I truly believe that remote work could be the future of mankind, but that said I don’t believe every person is ready to do remote work yet. It takes a lot of discipline, and you end up by always working a bit more. You can read some notes I made about remote work on <a href="/writing/remote-work">this post</a>.
