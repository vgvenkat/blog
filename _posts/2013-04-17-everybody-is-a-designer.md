There's no better time to be a designer. It's mainstream and people think that it's easy to join a startup and design the next big solution to the world. And some times it just becomes the next big problem to a niche.

## Everyone wants to be a designer
With smartphones and tablets everyone started to consume more design. Not just thinking about physical devices but about all apps that exist within those devices.

From mom's to CEO's, more than never, people want to give opinions and say how things should look or work. Why? Because it's too easy to say something when you're outside the problem. It's easy to redesign Facebook or Twitter and post it on Dribbble. Easy to critique Apple's skeumorphism. But do these people really understand the problems that these companies are trying to solve? Do they have enough information about what they're doing for the future?

One of the core values of design is a clear vision of what it could be. It all should start with a function. A reason to exist. To praise possible users. This requires time and maturity. Maturity to understand, to design for businesses, for users. Creating beautiful flat design to show it to the design community is not design. It's art.

## Outsourced vs Handmade Design
As an amateur chef, I like to compare design and food. You can apply lean concepts and do quick and good food. But when you dive in and understand ingredients characteristics, how the heat iterates with the food and more advanced stuff, it starts to become more and more close to perfection. A great example of life devoted to food is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/" target="_blank">Jiro</a>.

You can outsource design, hire companies to do it. But when you put great designers together inside your company you reach another level of iteration and probably you will start to solve real problems with great pixel solutions. It's all about handmade design, the art of really digging deep into the pixel work, with precision and love for every pixel.

## The Future
Since we are in an age where everyone is consuming more and more design every day, I started to notice that people can differentiate between really bad design and really good design.

But in the end, they should understand that great designers dedicate a lot of time to improve skills and make things functional. So they deserve some respect. Like a doctor when he decides you have to do a surgery or Jiro when he serves you the best sushi he can.
