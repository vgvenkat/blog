You probably heard about Pomodoro Technique, a simple process to help you improve your productivity and focus. If not [take a look](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/download/pdf/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf) at the PDF, it's free. With this said I wanna talk here about how I mix concepts of Pomodoro with music and how it works for me.

## Focus
Human beens have in general a big problem called procrastination and and it keeps us from doing what we really need to do. I believe that what helps us to procrastinate more or less is the definition of tasks. If you don't have a very clear thing to do you probably will jump to another thing, that some times is not related with the task we need to do.

A good example is when you have to research for something to define what you have to do and ends browsing some not related site or even checking feeds on social network. And boom, you just lost your focus and to go back you need some time.

This gets even worse if you work in a big company when you have colleagues or teammates arriving to your desk to ask something or sometimes just to do some easy talk. Some studies talk about 20-25 minutes to recover the entire focus. Multiply this to the number of interruptions you have and you can see that sometimes you just lost you work day.

## Using music to hack it
Backing to the Pomodoro one thing to start is to doing every morning or night before a list of tasks you wanna do during the day. Be honest with yourself. You can't do more than one at the same time so break tasks until you have a possible and defined list.

What I do with music and this I guess is very personal is to sync full albums with a task or a list of tasks and in this playing time (more or less 60 minutes) I don't allow people or other things to distract me. So in the end I have my mind completely focused in a time-range. You can apply this do playlists to. It's even easy to control the time you wanna focus.

But not every music is appropriate to create the mindset you need to focus. As a musician there's some artists that I'm a huge fan that is complicate to focus on the music and tasks I have to do so I try to avoid this ones just to keep my sanity :)

After a period of focus the reward could be read something useful, going for a stretch and walk around the office, drink a long sip of water or just relax for 5 minutes before dive into another tasks.

## Bands/artists that keep me on focus
Music is very personal but I guess it does not hurt to suggest some bands/artists to listen :)
