This is not about one of the [greatest songs of all times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations) or a [SF sex shop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations_(sex_shop)). This is about how working with people on the same vibration should make your daily job better and even contribute to the success of your company.

## It starts in a molecular level

There are some theories like [quantum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_theory) or [string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) that explain more about vibration in a molecular level. You can believe or not but if you translate all scientific stuff to everyday life you start observing that it makes sense.

You probably in some point of your life met someone that at first sight make you feel in a bad mood. Can you imagine a whole company with this kind of people? It does not matter if they're good professionals or not. What really matters is that they have the power of make everything around messy.

And for really big companies it is difficult to solve this kind of problem, cause you achieved a level that you don't really have control of everyone but if you starting a team or a company, you can control this and should be ready for feel and deal with all kinds of people on interviews.

## Be part of the company culture

The dreaming culture everyone is looking for on a job is not just about having free soda machines and free food all time. It is about employees having the same vibration, being optimistic, spreading good mood and believing in the future of the company. So start looking at your team mates, let them be always in a good vibration and always talk with them. Sometimes people just need to talk to release something bad and be good again :)
