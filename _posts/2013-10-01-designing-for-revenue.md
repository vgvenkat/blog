There's no perfect formula to build and keep a product roadmap on a design team. It usually start with a lot of conversation, probably a document with a lot of comments, some discussions for different priorities but the way you present and keep is up to you and your team. So in the end it is important to figure out the best order to do projects.

## One formula I use

In the past 3 years, I had opportunity to experiment some clever and dumb ways to do it. If you are working in early startup fighting for scale and profits you probably know that money income/outcome can change a lot fast. And we need to discover the best ways to prioritize tasks and projects. 

Let's think that we have an early stage e-commerce startup that have 3 design projects to the next 2 months

* They wanna improve the faq/help page cause they're scaling fast and the customers have common questions. For now, Is smarter to invest in the help page than hire more employees to answer common questions.
* The checkout page looks like you're in a crappy site so their hypothesis is if they fix at least the look and feel and basic usability problem the page can easily look more trustable and drive more sales.
* And also they wanna make all the static pages consistent with the product look and feel cause some pages was done in super early stages and never touched again.

My design roadmap for this scenario will be something like the chart below. You can use any basic tool to do that. The important here is to measure money x time. But please don't think too much in money. This just illustrates something you should think when you own a position in a business company.

If you have paying customers you should always take care of them first and also if you can help a customer to find common question quickly it probably will lead conversion. New checkout is not always really a new for now. In the end will be probably a front-end hack and will possible drive a better conversion rate. Static Pages are always a bad legacy to have so if it is not critical to the users, let it for later.
