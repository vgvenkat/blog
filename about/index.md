I am Developer doing my contribution to the open web. I focus on javascript, react and ocassionaly react-native. I am from India, studied and worked for a few years in India and currently on the way to Canada.

Intrigued by a lot of new tech, I dabble a few posts on that as well. I am a Wantrepreneur.

Take a look at my blogs or get in touch on the <a href="https://twiter.com/vgkrish">tweeter</a> or email.
